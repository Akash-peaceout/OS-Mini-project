Problem :

There is a sushi Bar which can accomodate 5 customers, that is there are a max of 5 seats to sit. 
Now if a new customer comes and finds an empty seat, he can take that seat and start eating. 
But if he finds all the seats occupied, then he has to wait for all the 5 people to finish dining and leave.
